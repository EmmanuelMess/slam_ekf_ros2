# SLAM Extended Kalman Filter

This project aims to implement the vanila EKF SLAM algorithm in a simple simulated environment in Gazebo and ROS2 (Galactic).

## Setup
The Turtlebot3 Burger is used for simulation in a custom Gazebo world. The landmarks of the environment consist of cylinders whose centers serve as the landmark coordinates.
